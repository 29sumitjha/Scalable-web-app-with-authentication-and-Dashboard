## Day 1: Backend Development


#### Project Setup
- Created project structure
- Initialized Node.js backend
- Installed dependencies: express, mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, dotenv, cors
- Set up MongoDB connection (local instance)
- Configured environment variables

**Commands Executed:**
```bash
mkdir scalable-web-app && cd scalable-web-app
mkdir backend && cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv cors express-validator
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

**Issues Encountered:**
- MongoDB connection initially showed "undefined" error

#### Database Models & Middleware

- Implemented JWT authentication middleware
- Added error handling middleware
- Created validation utilities

**Files Created:**
- `src/models/User.js`
- `src/models/Task.js`
- `src/middleware/auth.js`
- `src/middleware/errorHandler.js`
- `src/utils/validation.js`

#### API Routes & Controllers

```
âœ“ User Registration: SUCCESS (201 Created)
âœ“ User Login: SUCCESS (200 OK, token received)
âœ“ Get Current User: SUCCESS (200 OK)
âœ“ Update Profile: SUCCESS (200 OK)
âœ“ Create Task: SUCCESS (201 Created)
âœ“ Get All Tasks: SUCCESS (200 OK)

- Added search and filter functionality
- Optimized database queries
- Added MongoDB indexes for performance

**Performance Improvements:**
- Added compound index on Task model: `{user: 1, status: 1}`
- Implemented query pagination (default 10 items per page)
- Added search by title and description

- Responsive grid layout

#### UI/UX Polish
- Added loading states
- Implemented error messages
- Added success notifications
- Improved responsive design
- Added smooth transitions and animations

**UI Enhancements:**
- Loading spinners for async operations
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Mobile-responsive navbar
- Card-based layout for tasks

#### Integration Testing
- Tested complete user flow (register â†’ login â†’ dashboard)
- Verified all CRUD operations through UI
- Tested form validations (client & server)
- Checked responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Verified token expiration handling

**Test Scenarios Completed:**
1. New user registration â†’ Success
2. User login â†’ Dashboard redirect â†’ Success
3. Create 5 tasks with different statuses â†’ Success
4. Edit task status and priority â†’ Success
5. Search functionality â†’ Success
6. Filter by status and priority â†’ Success
7. Profile update â†’ Success
8. Logout and re-login â†’ Success
9. Protected route access without login â†’ Redirected to login âœ“
10. Mobile responsive testing â†’ All elements functional âœ“

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: MongoDB Connection Error
**Problem:** Getting "undefined" error when connecting to MongoDB
**Root Cause:** Environment variables loading after database connection attempt
**Solution:** Moved `require('dotenv').config()` to the very first line of server.js
**Time Spent:** 15 minutes
**Learning:** Always load environment variables before any other imports

### Challenge 2: Tailwind CSS Memory Error
**Problem:** Node.js out of memory error with Tailwind v4
**Root Cause:** Tailwind v4 is still in beta and has memory allocation issues
**Solution:** Downgraded to stable Tailwind v3.4.1
**Time Spent:** 20 minutes
**Learning:** Use stable versions for production projects, avoid beta releases

### Challenge 3: Token Persistence
**Problem:** User logged out on page refresh
**Root Cause:** Token not persisted in localStorage
**Solution:** Store token in localStorage on login, retrieve on app initialization
**Time Spent:** 10 minutes
**Learning:** Implement proper token persistence strategy from the start
